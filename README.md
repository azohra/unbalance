# Unbalance

Unbalance is a script designed for MergerFS users who also utilize SnapRAID. It ensures that a specified path of data resides on a single disk in the pool. 

I wrote unblance to help migrate from an `mfs` create strategy to `epmfs` such that I could start using SnapRAID and never worry about hitting this quirk:

## Features
- Ensures a specified path is located on only one disk.
- Automatically scans disks in the pool to find the largest existing data path.
- Moves data to the largest disk, if needed.
- Provides clear logging and operation status updates.

## Installation
0. Make the script executable with `chmod u+x unbalance.sh`
1. Ensure you have `rsync` installed
2. Modify the disk list in `unbalance.sh` to match your mount points. 

```bash
# Configurable Parameters
disks=("/mnt/disk1" "/mnt/disk2" "/mnt/disk3" "/mnt/disk4")  # Array of disk mounts
```

## Usage
Run the script with the partial path you want to un-balance. Do not includ the disk or pool.

**Example:**
```bash
./unbalance.sh "tv/some-show (2024)"
```

### For a path that is already un-balanced, you would see
```bash
